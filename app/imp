Json response to gson
->copy the json and paste in the below url 
http://www.jsonschema2pojo.org/
copy and create all the classes from the above url

in retrofit the json url is divided in two parts 
base and end points

Example
https://api.androidhive.info/contacts/

This is base url that is upto domain:-https://api.androidhive.info


this is the end point:-/contacts

Create a class to initialize Retrofit with base url
ApiClient.class



Create interface for the second part of url that are the endpoints
MyInterface
where you can define  HTTP methods: @GET, @POST, @PUT, @DELETE, @PATCH or @HEAD.

In interface you just need to declare the method implementation would be done in the class where it is used
the json response would be wrapped in Call object
